SOLITAIRE CHECKER PUZZLE BY DAVID AHL

48 CHECKERS ARE PLACED ON THE 2 OUTSIDE SPACES OF A
STANDARD 64-SQUARE CHECKERBOARD.  THE OBJECT IS TO
REMOVE AS MANY CHECKERS AS POSSIBLE BY DIAGONAL JUMPS
(AS IN STANDARD CHECKERS).  USE THE NUMBERED BOARD TO
INDICATE THE SQUARE YOU WISH TO JUMP FROM AND TO.  ON
THE BOARD PRINTED OUT ON EACH TURN '1' INDICATES A
CHECKER AND '0' AN EMPTY SQUARE.  WHEN YOU HAVE NO
POSSIBLE JUMPS REMAINING, INPUT A '0' IN RESPONSE TO
QUESTION 'JUMP FROM ?'
